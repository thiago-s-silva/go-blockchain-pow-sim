# üöÄ GoBlockchain Project: Proof of Work (PoW) Simulation

This project is a simplified **Blockchain** simulation implemented in **Go (Golang)**, focusing on the fundamental concept of **Proof of Work (PoW)**. It demonstrates how blocks are created, chained, and validated through a computationally intensive mining process.

---

## üåü Overview

Our blockchain is a sequence of cryptographically linked blocks. Each block contains data (simulating transactions), a timestamp, the hash of the previous block, and a magical number called a **Nonce**. The security and integrity of the chain are ensured by the Proof of Work mechanism, which requires miners to find a `Nonce` that makes the block's hash satisfy a specific difficulty condition.

## ‚ú® Implemented Features

* **Block Structure (`Block`):** Defines the composition of each block in the chain, including `ID`, `Timestamp`, `Data`, `PreviousHash`, and `Nonce`.
* **Block Chaining:** Each block references the hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain.
* **Hash Generation (`CalculateHash`):** A function to generate the cryptographic hash of a block, essential for validation.
* **Proof of Work (PoW):**
    * **Adjustable Difficulty:** The simulation includes a **difficulty criterion** (e.g., the block hash must start with a certain number of zeros).
    * **Mining (`MineBlock`):** An iterative process where the miner searches for a `Nonce` that satisfies the difficulty criterion, consuming computational power.
* **Blockchain (`Blockchain`):** Manages the addition of new blocks and the validation of the chain's integrity.
* **Chain Validation:** Functions to verify if the block chain is intact and if all PoW hashes are valid.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

To run this project on your machine:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have **Go** (version 1.16 or higher) installed.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [project_folder]
    ```
3.  **Execute:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

When you run it, you'll see the simulation of block mining and their addition to the chain.

## üöÄ Next Steps (Potential Improvements)

This project serves as a foundation. To expand upon it, we could consider:

* **Mempool:** Introduce a "mempool" (memory pool) to manage pending transactions before they are included in a block.
* **Multi-Nodes/Workers:** Simulate multiple miners (goroutines) competing to find the next block, using Go Channels for coordination and communication.
* **Real Transactions:** Implement a more robust transaction structure and validation mechanisms.
* **Persistence:** Save the blockchain to disk so that data isn't lost when the program ends.
* **REST API:** Create an API interface to interact with the blockchain (add transactions, query blocks, etc.).
